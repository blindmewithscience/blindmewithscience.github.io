Hi! Welcome to my website! (And the first blog post on it!)

I'm still not sure what exactly what I want this website to be. Right now, I'm setting it up almost like an extended resume. One with more life, flair, personality, and actual thoughts about life. One that's more like *actual* me. Humans are much more than the positions they hold and the projects they do throughout life.

An extension of how this website will function is how this blog will function. I'm hoping that I can actually use this blog as a way of sharing my thoughts about life, what I'm up to, and more.

I've only successfully blogged once before.[^1] In January 2018, I co-wrote for a blog where a bunch of members of [ESP](https://esp.mit.edu/) shared their experiences as they taught abroad (in [MIT's GTL program](http://misti.mit.edu/global-teaching-labs)). You can find my posts [here](https://espgtl.home.blog/author/paoloadajar/), which talk about everything from crafting lesson plans to Italian culture to reflections on life.

I hope that this blog doesn't end up as just a "professional" blog --- one where the only updates are about internships and jobs and careers and projects I'm doing. (Not that there won't be those kinds of updates from time to time.)

I'm hoping that this blog and website can serve as a more faithful reflection of who I am as a person. The musings, the thoughts, the existential crises. To quote from [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uds93Lroht4) that is irrelevant in every way except for one line, "Life is not the mountaintops / It's the walking in between."

So I guess that's my goal. To put a human face on a resume. To be an actual person to the world. To help people to learn who I *really* am, even if they've never met me. (And for those who have met me, to keep them updated on who I am and what I'm up to.)

So, hello!
