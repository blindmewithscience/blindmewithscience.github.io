title: "fun etymologies"

Economics graduate schools require the [GRE General Test](https://www.ets.org/gre), a test of students knowledge in high school math, random vocabulary, and technqiues of writing a basic essay. This test is somewhat absurd --- a copy of the SAT that is effectively no harder yet costs $205 to take and $27 to send scores per school.[^1] I registered for the GRE about a month ago and took it on Monday.[^2] Studying for the GRE wasn't exactly exciting. I mainly on the vocabulary section, as I haven't been the most voracious reader in college., and the math and writing sections seemed fairly straightforward.

The part that kept me engaged in this study is being able to learn about word etymologies. I love learning about the history of words, the changes in their nuances, how one language borrows from another, and more. I wrote one of my college application essays about how amazing it was to see the connections between different languages and words. Here's a collection of some fun word histories that I've found by studying for this test. These etymologies are taken from a myriad of sources, including the [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/), [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page), [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/), and Google's native etymology support when you search up a word.

Probably no one will ever find this blog post, but if you do, hopefully you've learned something cool.  

bombastic
: From the Greek word *bombyx*, meaning "silk" or "silkworm". The root word "bombast" 
originally referred to cottom padding used to fill up a garment; *bombast* and *bombastic* then 
took on a figurative meaning of "fluffing up" writing. While the literal meaning has gone away,
 the term *bombastic* remains as a term to describe pretensions, inflated language.

: hermetic
*Hermes Trismegistos*, or "Thrice-Great Hermes," is the supposed author of a series of texts that describe "spells and initiatory induction procedures" called the Hermetic Corpus, texts that later grew popular among alchemists in the 16th century. One of these texts described a process for making a glass tube airtight; this led the word *hermetic* meaning "sealed airtight" and also eventually to the word "hermit" (recluse). 

: sardonic, laconic
These two similar-looking words were both used by the Greeks as adjectiviesto describe their neighbors. Laconia was home of the Spartans, known for being terse -- thus, *laconic*. Similarly, *sardonic* is a reference to Sardinia, a reference first used in the Odyssey, meaning "scornfully mocking". While the reason for this reference is unclear, it's hypothesized that the Greeks beleaved that *sardonion*, a plant from Sardinia, could cause so much laughing that it could cill someone.

gauche
: In French, *gauche* simply means "left". Its has a meaning in French of "awkward", and 
derives from older roots meaning "to veer" and older roots meaning "to trample". Even older 
roots in Proto-Indo-European meaning "bend" or "curve" also led to the word *wink*.

panegyric

: blandishment
*Blandishment* is related to the word *bland*, but have quite different meanings. They both come from the Latin word *blandus* meaning "soft" or "smooth". *Bland* got the "dull, uninteresting" side of *blandus*, whereas *blandishment* now means flattery, or  "smoothing over".

cozen
: The background on this word meaning "to cheat or defraud" is ambiguous. One interpretation suggests that it is related to the word *cousin* and the French word *cousiner* meaning "to cheat on pretext of being a cousin." Another theory suggests that it is related to the Middle English word *cosyn*, which itself derives from co√ßon, a word in Old French meaning "trader". This in turn derives from *cocionem*, a Latin word meaning "horse dealer". 

aspersion
: There are two definitions for aspersion: the sprinkling of water during religious ceremonies, and the far more common meaning of an attack on someone's character. The Latin word *asperus* means "to sprinkle", and Shakespeare used this as to describe a sprinkling of rain that was percieved as a blessing. However,

If you'd like to read more fun etymologies, I suggest [The Word Detective](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IAIZAAS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by John Simpson, who served as Chief Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary for 20 years. While his book is not just about etymology (it's a memoir of his life and becoming involved with the OED), every few pages has an aside about the obscure origin of some word or phrase. 

[^1] However, the GRE does allow you to send 4 free score reports. How generous.

[^2] Since them, some graduate programs have decided to not accept the GRE at all, the most prominent being [UC Berkeley](https://web.archive.org/web/20200620165217/https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/grad/admissions). It remains to be seen whether all of my studying was for nothing :|
