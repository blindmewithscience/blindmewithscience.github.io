Economics graduate schools require the [GRE General Test](https://www.ets.org/gre), a test of students knowledge in high school math, random vocabulary, and technqiues of writing a basic essay. This test is somewhat absurd --- a copy of the SAT that is effectively no harder yet costs $205 to take and $27 to send scores per school.[^1] I registered for the GRE about a month ago and took it on Monday.[^2] Studying for the GRE wasn't exactly exciting. I mainly on the vocabulary section, as I haven't been the most voracious reader in college., and the math and writing sections seemed fairly straightforward.

The part that kept me engaged in this study is being able to learn about word etymologies. I love learning about the history of words, the changes in their nuances, how one language borrows from another, and more. I wrote one of my college application essays about how amazing it was to see the connections between different languages and words. Here's a collection of some fun word histories that I've found by studying for this test. Probably no one will ever find this list, but it's a good list nonetheless.

bombastic
: From the Greek word *bombyx*, meaning "silk" or "silkworm". The root word "bombast" originally referred to cottom padding used to fill up a garment; bombast and bombastic then took on a figurative meaning of "fluffing up" writing. While the literal meaning has gone away, the term bombastic remains as a term to describe pretensions, inflated language.

: hermetic
[from the belief that Hermes Trismegistus invented a magic seal to keep vessels airtight]

sardonic, laconic
sc

recalcitrant

fulminate


gauche

panegyric

blandishment 9soft, smooth -> bland

cozen

aspersion - baptism to negative 

sycophant

toady

desultory

factotum

juggernaut

meretricious


If you'd like to read more fun etymologies, I suggest [The Word Detective](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IAIZAAS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by John Simpson, who served as Chief Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary for 20 years. While his book is not just about etymology (it's a memoir of his life and becoming involved with the OED), every few pages has an aside about the obscure origin of some word or phrase. 

[^1] However, the GRE does allow you to send 4 free score reports. How generous.

[^2] Since them, some graduate programs have decided to not accept the GRE at all, the most prominent being [UC Berkeley](https://web.archive.org/web/20200620165217/https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/grad/admissions). It remains to be seen whether all of my studying was for nothing :|
