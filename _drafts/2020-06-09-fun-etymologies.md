title: "fun etymologies"

Economics graduate schools require the [GRE General Test](https://www.ets.org/gre), a test of students knowledge in high school math, random vocabulary, and technqiues of writing a basic essay. This test is somewhat absurd --- a copy of the SAT that is effectively no harder yet costs $205 to take and $27 to send scores per school.[^1] Studying for the GRE isn't exactly exciting. I've mainly been focusing on the vocabulary section, as I haven't been the most voracious reader in college. 

The part that keeps me engaged in this study is being able to learn about word etymologies. I love learning about the history of words, the changes in their nuances, how one language borrows from another, and more. I wrote one of my college application essays about how amazing it was to see the connections between different languages and words. Here's a collection of some fun word histories that I've found by studying for this test.

bombastic
: From the Greek word *bombyx*, meaning "silk" or "silkworm". The root word "bombast" originally referred to cottom padding used to fill up a garment; bombast and bombastic then took on a figurative meaning of "fluffing up" writing. While the literal meaning has gone away, the term bombastic remains as a term to describe pretensions, inflated language.

exonerate, onerous
: These two words share a nice origin: the Latin word *onus* meaning "burden" or "load" (today, the slightly more nuanced meaning of "duty" or "responsiblity". Onerous refers to tasks or duties that are exceptionally burdensome; exonerate, to absolve someone of guilt (in other words, "releasing someone from their burden".


If you'd like to read more fun etymologies, I suggest [The Word Detective](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IAIZAAS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by John Simpson, who served as Chief Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary for 20 years. While his book is not just about etymology (it's a memoir of his life and becoming involved with the OED), every few pages has an aside about the obscure origin of some word or phrase. 

[^1] However, the GRE does allow you to send 4 free score reports. How generous.
