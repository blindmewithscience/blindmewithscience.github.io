# Chapter 1

### Dashboard:

* Health: 2/4. General health in fitness, but have been gaining weight in quarantine. Mental health is decent right now, but not very, very good. Design problem: How to get myself to exercise more / eat better.

* Work: 3/4. Doing pretty good at being a student, doing good in ESP/Science Bowl. Unclear how fulfilling I find economics things, but hopefully I do. How to find “real work” that brings me joy, makes me feel like I’m growing.

* Play: 1/4. Been playing more games recently, but unclear how fulfilling they are vs. just being distractions. Not great at hanging out with friends, but slowly being better. design problem: how do I set aside time for meaningful/worthwhile things without feeling like I’m dipping into work tha tmuch.

* Love: 3.5/4. Things are good here. I like caragay a lot. Friends are good. How to prioritize more, how to think about long term.

  ### Workview

  I work because it’s interesting. Learning about new concepts, solving interesting problems, feeling like I’m growing. I care about making a difference to the people surrounding my work (see ESP, helping in pset groups, etc.). I like to feel like I can directly help people through my work (teaching classes at ESP); while I think that having a good mission overall is good, I’m not sure if I connect with that as much. It’s worthwhile if I don’t feel bored, don’t feel like I’m doing busywork / not being pushed. Something should come out of it; I want to feel like I’ve made some kind of difference. Money doesn’t feel particularly important to me, besides just being able to make ends meet. 

  ### Lifeview

  I care about people. I like having good conversations with people, learning about them, trying to articulate thoughts. My life is mostly defined by my close friends, people that I interact with regularly, rather than the place that I come from or country or whatever. I’m not sure whether it’s a pursuit of happiness (short-term or long-term), but I know that community and connectness value much for me.

  ------

  They inherently clash because of the individualistic nature of my workview (development of self), but align in the making surroundings better. I sometimes view these things as a tradeoff: spending more time working, trying to figure out difficult problems, as opposed to spending time thinking about people in my life. As a result, I find myself needing to choose between them, often feeling like I’m out of balance (in favor of work).

  I’d like the lifeview to drive the workview more: I wrote about that in my personal statement, after all.
