title: "how to restore a whiteboard, mit style"
three years of whiteboard cleaning

This blog post is an ode to whiteboards, which I love very, very dearly. My own history with whiteboards, how I use them in my life, and perhaps most importantly, *how to fix old and dirty whiteboards*.

You know how recipes often start off with seven introductory paragraphs of backstory? “My grandma first made me this recipe in the summer of 1963, the hottest summer we ever had…”? Those are worst. So I’m starting this off with the guide of how to restore whiteboards that don’t function well anymore. If you want all of that other content, scroll down below the how-to :P

This is a guide for how to restore an old, dingy whiteboard that:

* has marks or stains from heavy usage for a long time that no longer come out by normal means, or
* no longer erases well at all — when you write on it and try to erase, it leaves smears or stains.

This guide is ***not***

* a permanent fix; it will need to be repeated as often as needed (personally, I do it about once a semester, but the whiteboard is definitely dirty by the end)
* intended to be used on new whiteboards that still erase well; this will ruin the existing coating that is on the whiteboard. **Only do this on old whiteboards!**

With those caveats aside, let’s start.

Materials required:

* whiteboard (duh)
* paper towels
* washcloths that you don’t mind getting dirty
* white toothpaste (i prefer Arm and Hammer with Baking Soda), as unscented as you can get unless you really want your room smelling like mint
* isopropyl alcohol (>90%, ideally)
* a can of WD-40 that has a spray nozzle (*not* the tube) — this (insert spray bottle) is an acceptable alternative

1. Erase the whiteboard as much as you can using just an eraser. Basically, you’re trying to get out as many surface stains as you can. (It’s likely that smudges from erasing and that really old marker may be left on the board — that’s ok! we’ll remove them in the next step.)

2. Next, we’ll get out all of the long-term stains that are on the whiteboard. Squeeze out two fingertips of toothpaste onto your fingers, and smear it into an 8”×8”(ish) area of the board by making “lines” of toothpaste that are separated by a couple inches. The area is variable, and is basically as much area as your toothpaste dollop can cover. (See below for a visual explanation)

   Using a washcloth, rub the toothpaste in circles on the whiteboard until the toothpaste has been all removed from the area. Repeat if there are still visual stains that you can see in the area. 

   Continue with the rest of the whiteboard until you’re left with a clean board!. (As best you can, always do the circle-motion with a clean part of your washcloth, switching out washcloths as necessary.)

3. After the previous step, there may still be a few lingering “smudge” stains that are on the whiteboard; in addition, there may be a tiny bit of residual toothpaste on the board. To fix both of these problems, put some isopropyl alcohol on a paper towel, and wipe down the entire board. Let dry. Repeat as necessary until the entire whiteboard feels smooth to the touch.

4. If you still see areas with any surface stains, repeat steps 2 and 3 on that area alone. You want to make your whiteboard as spotless as possible before the next step.

   In addition, make sure that your whiteboard is *completely dry* by using paper towels or washcloths before proceeding.

5. Finally, we need to “resurface” the whiteboard so that there are fewer stains in the future.

   Spray your whiteboard lightly with WD-40. (I’ve covered the edges of my whiteboard with painter’s tape to avoid spraying the wood finish.)

   Use a paper towel to spread the coating evenly across the entire whiteboard. The paper towel will quickly become saturated with WD-40, but keep using the same paper towel to spread the coating; this way, you pick up as little WD-40 with your paper towel as possible. 

   WD-40 “plugs” the microscopic holes in your whiteboard that caused stains — marker ink could get into the holes but then couldn’t be erased.

6. Let sit for a few hours, then use another paper towel to make sure that there is no excess WD-40 on the board. I personally do this until my paper towel picks up no more WD-40 at all, but this is probably a bit excessive.

And voila! A whiteboard that is clean and collects marker smudge much more slowly. I’ve noticed that on my own whiteboard, this process causes some *colors* of whiteboard markers to smudge more than other colors. YMMV, depending on how old your whiteboard is. (This whiteboard has seen heavy use for a long time, and so is definitely on the much more worn side.)

Some bonus tips:

* Toothpaste + washcloths will also get out marker stains that exist on wood (which can happen if you have a wooden marker holder, like this whiteboard).
* Don’t use any form of tape on the whiteboard — it ruins the finish D: 
* Erase frequently so that

As you maybe can tell by now, I *love* whiteboards. Like, seriously love whiteboards. Now comes the actual blog post part :P 

## my history with whiteboards

I was not always a whiteboard person. My high school did have whiteboards in all of its classrooms, and I definitely spent much time at the board working on problems, particularly in my calculus and physics classes, which both had “flipped” classroom setups and dedicated homework-time in class.

It was also in high school that I began teaching. I spent many, many hours at the front of a classroom with a whiteboard beside me, trying to explain the *why* of solving math problems, the reasoning and thought processes behind combinatorics and number theory and more. In retrospect, this probably did much to influence how much I rely on having a large workspace to figure out my thoughts.

At MIT, I found a world filled with vast expanses
