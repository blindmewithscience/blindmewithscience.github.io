These topics don't quite belong in the same blog post. It probably could be three separate blog posts. And maybe should be separate.

But they also kind all fit into a larger theme. What larger theme, I'm not quite sure. Maybe I'll know by the time I finish this post.

## choices
Why do we worry about choices?

* talk about what if musical
* making choices but agonizing over decisions
	* deciding about colleges, deciding about internships
	* what to do with life
* some are actually bidning, some just feel bidning
* remembering that decisions can always change 

summary
* we think about a lot of our choices for only minimal differences, or where we don't actually know what space we're deciding over

*we focus our attention in decisions away from things that we don't know about, bibcycle shed

* how do we make deicsions? badly. hm. 

* rather than taking htis all as reasons for not making choices with much thought, it measn that we should think very carefully about hohw we think

## arbitraryness

what choices in my life have been arbitrary?
* doing economics
* all the things i did in high school
* joining esp
* running a science bowl
* literal random roommates

## storytelling
* advice from a physics professor: "learn how to tell a story"
* applying for fellowshpis: even if things aren't quite a story, tunring it in to one

* how much can i actually look 

* try and remember the thing tha ttalked about how people awlays believe themseves to be the agents of change in their lives
