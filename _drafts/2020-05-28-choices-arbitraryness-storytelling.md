title: "on choices, arbitraryness, and storytelling"
---

As I think more about applying to grad school and reflecting on my own MIT
experience, there’s been a few different themes that keep coming up. The three
themes in this post are connected to each other just a little bit, and so I
figured I’d make one big blog post to talk about them all.

choices
-------

Critics didn’t particularly like [If/Then](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/If/Then)
when it hit Broadway, in part because of its lack of strong songs and confusing
narrative structure. This happened despite a star studded cast, including Idina
Menzel playing the main character, Elizabeth.

The musical opens with Elizabeth trying to decide between different directions
to move her life in. Her friend Kate suggests that “Liz” begin trying new
things, while Lucas suggests that “Beth” become more focused on her work life.
The rest of the musical follows each of these two possibilities and how their
storylines intertwine and differ. (Critics complained that distinguishing
between the two storylines was too difficult for casual enjoyment.)

In the opening song, ‘What If?”, Elizabeth monologues about her predicament in
choosing exactly how to reinvent herself.

>   Do I go there with Lucas  
>   Or stay here with Kate?  
>   Why do I do this?  
>   Obsess and debate  
>   I've been prudent and cautious  
>   For all my life long  
>   And most of my choices  
>   Turned out to be wrong  
>   Tell me how can this make any difference?  
>   How could it matter at all?  
>   How do I make such a major event  
>   Out of something so small?  
>   ...  
>   See each choice you make as kind of a loss  
>   Each turn that you take  
>   And each coin that you toss  
>   You lose all the choices  
>   You don't get to make  
>   You wonder about  
>   All the turns you don't take  
>   And so what if I’d gone there with Lucas?  
>   And then what if I'd answered that phone?

>   If only you'd known...

Looking at my own decision-making process about “big” things – choosing careers
and majors, discussing with ESP about how to run our programs – there’s a few
parts that I often get “stuck” on, some of which connect really strongly to the
lyrics of *What If?*. These parts aren’t mutually exclusive nor are they really
even all that distinct. But I don’t really have a way to organize these thoughts
other than a list.

-   **Not knowing what impact things make.** Much like Elizabeth in *If/Then*,

-   Attention to the wrong things. Bicycle shed effect.

-   Putting more energy into things when the different in outcomes is small

-   Feeling like you’re closing off doors by makig any decisoin

Why do we worry about choices?

-   talk about what if musical

-   making choices but agonizing over decisions

    -   deciding about colleges, deciding about internships

    -   what to do with life

-   some are actually bidning, some just feel bidning

-   remembering that decisions can always change

summary

-   we think about a lot of our choices for only minimal differences, or where
    we don't actually know what space we're deciding over

-   we focus our attention in decisions away from things that we don't know
    about, bibcycle shed

-   how do we make deicsions? badly. hm.

-   rather than taking htis all as reasons for not making choices with much
    thought, it measn that we should think very carefully about hohw we think

arbitraryness
-------------

When I lived in Iowa, one of my teachers recommended that I take an online AP
Microeconomics class to fill up my schedule and keep myself busy. That led me to
take even more economics courses after I moved to Nevada, starting research, and
eventually applying to MIT as a mathematical economics major. Now I’m planning
to go to grad school and keep doing economics for the rest of my life, all
because my teacher recommended one class to me a very long time ago.

Joining MIT as a freshman and scrolling through the list of clubs, I found a
club that ran programs related to education. I went to a meeting because I
thought it was going to be a club with people who liked to teach. It turned out
to be a bit of that, but also a lot more. Now I’ve spent 3 years and found a
great family in ESP, all because I didn’t quite understand a description on a
website.

There’s a lot of things in my life that have happened by seemingly random
chance. Choosing clubs in high school off of the basis of small interactions
with people I just met. Getting randomly assigned roommates at MIT. Running a
science bowl because the previous coordinator happened to live on the same floor
as me. Becoming close friends with someone after 3 years of knowing each other
because we sat next to each other and wanted to play an inside joke on a mutual
friend. So many more details of who I am, the people I’m close to, the things I
care about have seemed like they happened because of random chance.

It’s so interesting to look back at what makes *us* and small actions that
caused them to happen. Some of them feel like active choices: coming to MIT,
choosing my major, and deciding to be friends with someone. But so many of these
important decisions have been impacted by happenstance occurrences in my life.

As much as I’d like to feel like I am the person “in control” of my life, so
many fundamental things about my life have been caused by sheer randomness. In
an ever-so-slightly different world, my science-y friends in high school would
have led me down that path even more and made me a physicist instead. Or I’d
have a different set of friends because I ran into different people my freshman
year. So many of my close friendships have resulted from me randomly running
into someone and deciding that that moment was a good time to start having a
conversation.

I suppose that the last two sections seem a bit nihilistic. If making choices
well is incredibly difficult, and so many of the important things of our lives
happen because of things outside of our control, then someone could reasonable
conclude that none of our actions actually matter.

Talk about the “if choices are bad and imptrant things happen arbitrarily, what
to do”

Past two sections might seem pessimistic

storytelling
------------

When I took Relativity at MIT, the professor ended the class by giving us four
pieces of advice. One of those pieces of advice was to “learn how to tell a
story.” This skill would be invaluable, he said, for figuring out how to get
people to listen to you.

About a month ago, I called the Distinguished Fellowships Office at MIT to chat
with them about programs like the Fulbright, Rhodes, Marshall, and others. One
of the key pieces of advice they gave was to craft some narrative to explain why
it is I wanted to do things.

I’ve heard the same advice for applying to grad school: explain how everything
that you’ve done has helped you narrow down your interests and decide on a
certain field. It doesn’t matter if you’re still not sure, because what you say
isn’t binding. You just have to be able to say that you’re interested in
*something* and explain why.

I don’t know about the rest of the world, but when I make decisions, my world
doesn’t change in exactly the way I want to do achieve exactly my goals. Random
things happen that push me in one direction or another. I find myself liking
certain things coincidentally, just because something happened at the right time
and right place. And that isn’t even to mention that any choice I make is done
on incomplete information and without knowing what would happen.

I’ve had to do my fair share of storytelling in my life – college applications,
consulting, even research, all try to paint a certain picture, tell a story of
how something came to be. In a sense, it feels *insincere* to try and tell
stories like this. Sure, I can always look back at my actions and make arguments
for how different actions and circumstances led me to the person I am today. But
I certainly didn’t (and don’t) have the foresight to know exactly how the
choices I made would create me.

In my acting class this semester, we read a play called “Everybody” and recorded
a monologue of it. This play touches on many themes, from friendship to
materialism to the meaning of life itself. The play begins with Death telling
the main character, Everybody, that they are dying, but that God wants to hear
an account of their full life. After Death leaves, everybody begins
contemplating their life to try and create an account.

“One whole airtight personal macrophilosophy of being.” The norm that we try to
hold when we try to show off some “image” of ourselves in interviews,
applications, and the like. Don’t talk about the flaws, the missteps, the
mistakes. The right choices made for the wrong reasons (or for no reason at
all). The arbitrary factors that lead someone to stumble into the person that
they are today.

At the same time, I look at other people, their resumes, what they’ve done with
their lives. Sometimes, it *does* seem so pre-packaged and airtight and fully
planned out. It’s probably some form of imposter syndrome. It seems pretty
likely that no one really does know what they’re doing and are just fumbling
around like I am. Or maybe it is the case that some people really do just have
it all together like that.

I’m feeling this feeling a lot more as I look back at what I did at MIT and
prepare to apply to graduate school. A different person would have known what
they wanted to do after graduation since they started MIT. Taken all of the math
classes they needed to and more, try out various fields of research, and so the
list goes on. Granted, the things that I ended up doing at MIT put me in a good
position for applying to graduate school. But it’s far from the “optimized” that
I see some people have.

A piece of advice that I’ve heard a few times that I’ve found helpful is to
simply do what I’m interested in, do what makes me happy, and the rest will fall
into places. My choices will be vaguely in the right directions. Enough
arbitrariness will lead me towards my goals. It’s the mindset I tried to take
through college applications, and hearing the same advice again from a few
people has helped me as I think about this process of applying again. But I
still can’t help feeling that I’m not doing enough by optimizing for my current
state, and not optimizing for some future goal.
