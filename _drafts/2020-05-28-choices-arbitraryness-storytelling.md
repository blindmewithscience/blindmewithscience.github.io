title: "on choices, arbitrariness, and storytelling"
---

As I think more about applying to grad school and reflecting on my own MIT experience, there’s been a few different themes that keep coming up. The three themes in this post are connected to each other just a little bit, and so I figured I’d make one big blog post to talk about them all.

choices
-------

Critics didn’t particularly like [If/Then](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/If/Then) when it hit Broadway, in part because of its lack of strong songs and confusing narrative structure. This happened despite a star studded cast, including Idina Menzel playing the main character, Elizabeth.

The musical opens with Elizabeth trying to decide between different directions to move her life in. Her friend Kate suggests that “Liz” begin trying new things, while Lucas suggests that “Beth” become more focused on her work life. The rest of the musical follows each of these two possibilities and how their
storylines intertwine and differ. (Critics complained that distinguishing between the two storylines was too difficult for casual enjoyment.)

In the opening song, ‘What If?”, Elizabeth monologues about her predicament in choosing exactly how to reinvent herself.

>   Do I go there with Lucas  
>   Or stay here with Kate?  
>   Why do I do this?  
>   Obsess and debate  
>   I've been prudent and cautious  
>   For all my life long  
>   And most of my choices  
>   Turned out to be wrong  
>   Tell me how can this make any difference?  
>   How could it matter at all?  
>   How do I make such a major event  
>   Out of something so small?  
>   ...  
>   See each choice you make as kind of a loss  
>   Each turn that you take  
>   And each coin that you toss  
>   You lose all the choices  
>   You don't get to make  
>   You wonder about  
>   All the turns you don't take  
>   And so what if I’d gone there with Lucas?  
>   And then what if I'd answered that phone?  
>   Think of all of the things you’d have done  
>   If only you'd known...

Looking at my own decision-making process about “big” things – choosing careers and majors, discussing with ESP about how to run our programs, MIT's policies for the fall semester and returning – there’s a few parts that I often get “stuck” on, some of which connect really strongly to the lyrics of *What If?*. These different aspects, aren’t mutually exclusive nor are they really even all that distinct. But I don’t really have a way to organize these thoughts other than a list.

- **Not knowing what impact things make.** Much like Elizabeth in *If/Then*, I feel entirely uninformed about many decisions that I make. As one example, let's think about the process of choosing between college. After all was said and done with my college application process, I'd narrowed down my choice to 3 different colleges. Choosing between these colleges was *hard*. Each college had so many different aspects, from the interests of my peers to scholarship money to required classes to rigor to the *weather*, not even to mention the intangible aspects like how much I'd grow as a human being at these different places.

    Some of the aspects (like money) were quantifiable, many were not; it is entirely impossible for me to make exact inferences about how each college would shift my interests, career paths, and much more. Even if I were able to know each of these aspects exactly, I have no way of comparing them. How can one put a dollar value on the joy of weather? Or comparing academic rigor to the types of people I'd be around? Even 3 years into college and knowing everything that I know about my own college experience, while I can make judgements about whether my experience at MIT has been positive and worthwhile, I have absoutely no idea how it would compare to my experience at other universities. And I have no doubt that I'll feel this same way when I (hopefully) decide between graduate programs this spring.


- **The bicycle-shed effect.** Also called [Parkinson's Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), the essence of the bicycle-shed effect is that we turn our attention to the familiar, even if they are of relatively little importance. Parkinson gives a specific example of a committee approving a £10 million nuclear reactor and a £350 bike shed[^1]. While the details of a nuclear reactor might pass over people's heads due to their complexity, a bike shed has much more familiar aspects --- shape, size, roofing material --- and is discussed much more readily. 

    I first heard about this effect by name from ESP; while ESP as an organization does many things well (particularly in organizing discussions), this is decidedly a trap that we fall into occasionally in discussions. Whether it's literal discussions of budgets, 


		esp - easy to tlak much about things like housing, things like that

-   Putting more energy into things when the different in outcomes is small
		talk about cwg things? or differences between different internships? or colleges/grad schools?

-   Feeling like you’re closing off doors by making any decision
		life choices, majors, jobs


What to do from here? i certainly don't know good ways of making choices. but awarenesss of pitfalls is important.
^ I don't quite want to do this, the "what now" from here is just "well, these exist."

-   rather than taking htis all as reasons for not making choices with much
    thought, it measn that we should think very carefully about hohw we think

arbitrariness
-------------

When I lived in Iowa, one of my teachers recommended that I take an online AP Microeconomics class to fill up my schedule and keep myself busy. That led me to take even more economics courses after I moved to Nevada, starting research, and eventually applying to MIT as a mathematical economics major. Now I’m planning to go to grad school and keep doing economics for the rest of my life, all because my teacher recommended one class to me a very long time ago.

Joining MIT as a freshman and scrolling through the list of clubs, I found a club that ran programs related to education. I went to a meeting because I thought it was going to be a club with people who liked to teach. It turned out to be a bit of that, but also a lot more. Now I’ve spent 3 years and found a great family in ESP, all because I didn’t quite understand a description on a website.

There’s a lot of things in my life that have happened by seemingly random chance. Choosing clubs in high school off of the basis of small interactions with people I just met. Getting randomly assigned roommates at MIT. Running a science bowl because the previous coordinator happened to live on the same floor as me. Becoming close friends with someone after 3 years of knowing each other because we sat next to each other and wanted to play an inside joke on a mutual friend. So many more details of who I am, the people I’m close to, the things I care about have seemed like they happened because of random chance.

It’s so interesting to look back at what makes *us* and small actions that caused them to happen. Some of them feel like active choices: coming to MIT, choosing my major, and deciding to be friends with someone. But so many of these important decisions have been impacted by happenstance occurrences in my life.

As much as I’d like to feel like I am the person “in control” of my life, so many fundamental things about my life have been caused by sheer randomness. In an ever-so-slightly different world, my science-y friends in high school would have led me down that path even more and made me a physicist instead. Or I’d have a different set of friends because I ran into different people my freshman year. So many of my close friendships have resulted from me randomly running into someone and deciding that that moment was a good time to start having a conversation.


Discussion of things connecting luck and agency; deterministic universe / lack of free will? 

I suppose that the last two sections seem a bit nihilistic. If making choices well is incredibly difficult, and so many of the important things of our lives happen because of things outside of our control, then someone could reasonable conclude that none of our actions actually matter.

Talk about the “if choices are bad and imptrant things happen arbitrarily, what to do”


storytelling
------------

When I took Relativity at MIT, the professor ended the class by giving us four pieces of advice. One of those pieces of advice was to “learn how to tell a story.” This skill would be invaluable, he said, for figuring out how to get people to listen to you.

A few months ago, I called the Distinguished Fellowships Office at MIT to chat with them about programs like the Fulbright, Rhodes, Marshall, and others. One of the key pieces of advice they gave was to craft some narrative to explain why it is I wanted to do things.

I’ve heard the same advice for applying to grad school: explain how everything that you’ve done has helped you narrow down your interests and decide on a certain field. It doesn’t matter if you’re still not sure, because what you say isn’t binding. You just have to be able to say that you’re interested in *something* and explain why.

I don’t know about the rest of the world, but when I make decisions, my world doesn’t change in exactly the way I want to do achieve exactly my goals. Random things happen that push me in one direction or another. I find myself liking certain things coincidentally, just because something happened at the right time and right place. And that isn’t even to mention that any choice I make is done on incomplete information and without knowing what would happen. 

I’ve had to do my fair share of storytelling in my life – college applications, consulting, even research – all try to paint a certain picture, tell a story of how something came to be. In a sense, it feels *insincere* to try and tell stories like this. Sure, I can always look back at my actions and make arguments for how different actions and circumstances led me to the person I am today. But I certainly didn’t (and don’t) have the foresight to know exactly how the choices I made would create me. 

In my acting class this semester, we read a play called “Everybody” and we each had to record a monologue from it. This play touches on many themes, from friendship to materialism to the meaning of life itself. The play begins with Death telling the main character, Everybody, that they are dying, but that God wants to hear an account of their full life. After Death leaves, everybody begins contemplating their life to try and create an account.
 
>   You weren’t even fully aware of yourself as a self until what? Like early childhood? And then you certainly did not have some sense of life as a thing which could have a purpose until what? Late teens? And then your sense of self wasn’t really even solidified until all of the gray matter in your brain has been used up which was what? Twenty six, twenty seven? So this assignment is sort of like a trap! This seems like entrapment! Like human life is entrapment!  
>   It’s like you are expected to have had those instincts to pay attention to yourself just buried inside yourself – like a natural thing? Like it’s supposed to be coded into your DNA? So you know what? No. You are not going to beat yourself up for not having been genetically programmed to care about your own life beyond the necessity of survival and to the point of obsessiveness – to the point of pure, paralyzing self-consciousness. Tracking your every move, day in and day out, from birth onward, attempting to rationalize everything into one whole airtight personal macrophilosophy of being? No!

“One whole airtight personal macrophilosophy of being.” The norm that we try to hold when we try to show off some “image” of ourselves in interviews, applications, and the like. Don’t talk about the flaws, the missteps, the mistakes. The right choices made for the wrong reasons (or for no reason at all). The arbitrary factors that lead someone to stumble into the person that they are today. 

At the same time, I look at other people, their resumes, what they’ve done with their lives. Sometimes, it *does* seem so pre-packaged and airtight and fully planned out. It’s probably some form of imposter syndrome. It seems pretty likely that no one really does know what they’re doing and are just fumbling around like I am. Or maybe it is the case that some people really do just have it all together like that.

I’m feeling this feeling a lot more as I look back at what I did at MIT and prepare to apply to graduate school. A different person would have known what they wanted to do after graduation since they started MIT. Taken all of the math classes they needed to and more, try out various fields of research, and so the list goes on. Granted, the things that I ended up doing at MIT put me in a good position for applying to graduate school. But it’s far from the “optimized” that I see some people have.

A piece of advice that I’ve heard a few times that I’ve found helpful is to simply do what I’m interested in, do what makes me happy, and the rest will fall into places. My choices will be vaguely in the right directions. Enough arbitrariness will lead me towards my goals. It’s the mindset I tried to take through college applications, and hearing the same advice again from a few people has helped me as I think about this process of applying again. But I still can’t help feeling that I’m not doing enough by optimizing for my current state, and not optimizing for some future goal. In a sense, I want to be able to storytell in the *present*, not just in hindsight.




I don't think that there really is a conclusion to all of this. I can't end this with a "solution" or even "advice" -- obviously, I haven't figured out how to deal with these in my own life. Some of these things aren't even well-defined problems, much less ones with well-defined solutions. I suppose the point of this blog post was to just say these words, to just recognize these threads of choices, arbitrariness, and storytelling in my life.
