I like to think that people are defined by two things — the values that they hold and the choices that they make. So I figured that a half-decent way of introducing myself to the world is to share some decisions that I've made over the past few weeks across all *sorts* of areas in my life, just to give you a sense of all of the different things that I've had to think about recently. In alphabetical order [^1]:  

* **Bed: Amazon.** I had 2 other options: IKEA delivery and Wayfair delivery. IKEA lets you specify delivery on a specific day, but one of my friends told me a horror story about delivery (3 weeks to get a bed after the planned delivery date?) and so I decided against that. Wayfair says shipping will be "1-3 weeks" and I don't think I could deal with that uncertainty about when I get a mattress. Amazon is sketchy (there are *so* many reviews about people who have found mold on their Amazon beds) but I've decided that it's the best option I have. Worst comes to worst, air mattress for a few weeks.

* **Classes: 14.04 (Microeconomic Theory), 14.THU (Economics Thesis), 18.112 (Complex Analysis), 18.404 (Theory of Computation), 8.225 (History of Physics).** I am a 14-2 (Mathematical Economics), which means that I am an *exceptionally* rare unicorn[^5] at MIT. The quick rationales for classes that were on my Firehose[^11] but *didn't* end up making it on my class schedule are:

  * 14.121: Grad-level microeconomics, perhaps a bit *too* rigorous. And too many hours.
  * 14.661: Labor economics is really cool, but I just don't think I have time for it this semester. 
  * 6.036: mAcHiNe LeArNiNg. Wanted to take a class because I keep hearing about this thing called ML but never have actually taken any time to figure out what it's supposed to be. Maybe it's good to learn at some point. But I think I'm too busy for that time to be now.[^9]
  * 3.091 / 5.111: I am a bad example and am punting my Chemistry GIR[^7] to senior spring. This is bad procedure. Do not do this @frosh reading this blog. There's just lots more interesting classes in the fall for me than in the spring. Better hope I pass it next spring, or I'm not graduating[^6] …
  * 8.05: I've always wanted to take quantum mechanics and just spend time doing the math of it rather than just the "pop culture" things I see of "ooooo Schrödinger's cat" and "quAnTUm cOmPUtInG". I know that I will never have the motivation to self-study it ever on [OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), so maybe this is a thing I try to take *next* semester.
  * 11.011: Everyone who takes this class recommends it to everyone they know — they even wrote an [article](http://news.mit.edu/2017/class-negotiation-skills-1103) about it. I've kept telling myself that I would take it next semester, but now it's senior year and I just don't have time for it right now. Another one bites the dust :(
  * All the random HASS[^3] classes in the world: This section is already going on long enough, but there's literally dozens of HASS classes in the course catalog that I wish I could be taking this semester. 

* ESP Something: uhhh something about 

* **Grad schools: applying, but no idea to which yet.** I am very scared about what I am going to do with my life. I've tried many different things, from research to the government to the private sector (finance + economic consulting). This summer I tried out private sector things, and now I feel even more confused. The private sector is interesting and pays well, but it broadly focuses on macroeconomics which is not the area I care about — I like microeconomics, and focusing on people. Private sector is also much more about "quick iteration" rather than "spend a lot of time making sure that you're understanding the causal relationships between things" and I'm not sure I really like that. On the other hand, research tends to move more slowly to try to get to the right answers, but there's also the small problem of doing work in a very unstructured environment and where things entirely are up to you. I don't know if I can handle that.

  For now, applying to grad school seems like the best option. But there's still so much uncertainty about whether grad school is *right* for me, and that scares me. A lot.

* **Introduction post: you're reading it!** Finding the best way to say "Hello, world" is really hard. I'd thrown around a few ideas, from "akjdsnfksjdf i'm a blogger?!?!?!" to "the story of this summer" to "[screaming into the void about my senior year being not what i wanted]". But then I figured that I wanted to actually do something that as many different things about me as possible, and we're left with this mess of a blog post.

* **My blogging style: still in the works.** To be completely honest, one of my first ideas I had about what I wanted to do blogging something like "I want to rickroll someone. And my someone I mean everyone who reads these blogs. I'll start my first blog title with 'Never'. And then 'Gonna'. And then…" As you can tell by the title of this post, this is no longer the case. [^4]
  

I generally like the a e s t h e t i c of typing in all lowercase and very stream-of-conscious-y, but when I try to write like that, my writing still feels rough no matter how much I polish it. The current idea is that that tone is going to be more in my footnotes (and occasionally in the bodies of my blogs). And then maybe I'll also just link songs every chance that I get. It's definitely something that's going to evolve over time (I've only been blogging since the beginning of the summer, after 3 previous failed attempts) so we'll see how it goes.

* **Photo for the blogs: see above!** This was *definitely* the single most important recent choice for me: What photo do I send to admissions to get drawn for me? I have a slight problem where none of the photos that I am in look good. Part of it is that I am unphotogenic. Part of it is that I make the stupidest poses in every photo I am in. Options available to me include… 

  The winner ended up being a photo that was taken when I lived in a literal glass box on MIT's campus for 96 hours. But that's a story for another time.

* **Returning: off-campus in Central Square.** I'd signed a lease with some friends back in January, back when COVID was just something small and I could still give hugs to my friends. The end of last semester was hard for me class-wise; it's just so much harder to be any semblance of productive when you are not in an environment of MIT. When MIT's opening plan released in July, I had the option of either honoring my lease and living with my friends, or returning to campus, where I could have access to libraries/gyms, but all classes that could be online would be online. Econ majors are effectively the lowest priority on the "get to return" scale, and so even if I were on campus, I'd have exactly 0 classes to take in-person. So I kept my lease, turned down MIT housing; and I guess that means that I've taken my last class at MIT. Maybe even stepped my last foot in MIT before I graduate. [^8]

* **Science bowl: head-to-head invitational!** 

* **Thesis: oh NO.** 

So, that was a lot of words, and I still feel like there's still parts of me that you aren't getting. Sure, there's the other half of what I say makes up a person — values. But I don't think I'd solve the issue by rattling off the things that I value and pretending they're some prepackaged list that I just know. Even if I do share all of that, I don't think that's an introduction to who I *feel* like I am.

During my sophomores spring, I spent many lunches getting to know someone that I'm now good friends with. We'd grab food together about once a week in Maseeh[^10] and talk about all sorts of things, from what we were doing to the things that were important to us to problems in our life. One week, she said to me something along the lines of: "I'm telling you my problems in retrospect, after they're already solved; you're not getting the parts of my decisions where I'm struggling with everything and still figuring it out". And I feel the same way about the decisions that I'm writing about above; while I can give you some sense of all of the ways in which these decisions are hard, showing you these choices in hindsight is not the same as if I we did it by hanging out in my room and laying down on my rug and talking about all of the small and big things in life.

I am scared that I'm going to default into showing the put-together parts of me on these blogs, because naturally, sharing the worries and stressy and everything messy with thousands of strangers is not exactly easy. It's not any easier in person, either; I find myself constantly worrying about whether I'm posing and putting on a mask and not actually showing people who I really am. This last summer, I've grown worried about the idea that I'll head out into post-MIT life and people will only know the put-together parts — in essence, the "resume" version of me — and that the things that I feel define myself in the present will simply go away.

"Authenticity" and "vulnerable" are words that get thrown around a lot — I'm betting a decent chunk of you who have tried to find college admissions advice have probably heard them many times over in the context of how you should write your applications. I guess in the ultimate Senior Year 2: Electric Boogaloo, I'll be trying my best to be authentic with you all, because I do not think I can share my MIT without sometimes showing you the not-so-put-together parts of my existence at this college. The musings, the worries, the crises. Because my life and my experience is more than just the end result of decisions[^12].  

I have wanted to be a blogger since I was admitted to MIT, and have applied as many times as I can count[^13]. I lack the words to express the shock when I woke up and saw an email from Petey saying "YOU GOT THE GIG".  I've only got one real year[^2] of saying words to y'all, so I really do hope that I can share with you little slice of my experiences, my life, and my MIT. 

So, I guess this is hello c:

[^1]: i don't wanna order this by order of importance because variety is truly the spice of life, and if things go from least to most important you might just pay attention to the little things and get bored when you hit the big ones. or you might just scroll to the big decisions and [let the little things in life pass you by](https://youtu.be/YcqauC49Xmc?t=37). and ordering by chronological just means that i'm just sharing things relatively linearly and let me tell y'all my brain does not exactly work in straight lines. this post was drafted entirely non-linearly and so will the rest of my blog posts. for your amusement, the footnotes are in order of when they were typed.
[^2]: tbh, is this year even real? stay tuned for another episode of "what is going to go wrong next in 2020"! guys i just wish that we had a normal senior year :( and remember kids, time is a societal construct
[^3]: humanities, arts, and social sciences
[^4]: the first blog was going to be something like "never thought this would happen…" but then i got *really* stuck on what "gonna" was gonna be. depending on how far i got, "desert" is also pretty tough. this is my personal challenge to future bloggers to find *some* way to rickroll everyone. or maybe just meme in general. post made entirely of memes when?
[^5]: per the [registrar](https://registrar.mit.edu/statistics-reports/enrollment-statistics-year), the class of  2021 has 9 14-2 majors and 10 14-1 majors. i added the numbers for primary and secondary 14 majors, so numbers might not match up with the link before. pretty sure i've interacted with / been in a class with every 14-1 and 14-2 in my year. 
[^6]: aaaaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAaaaAAAaaa when did i become a senior i remember being a wee frosh and finding everything so new and exciting and now i am an old and alkjdsnflkjsaf someone please i am [not ready to be old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOIHNF2vJc)
[^7]: translation out of mit-ese: i am delaying the required chemistry class until the last possible moment. the [GIRs](https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/general-institute-requirements), which everyone must take, regardless of if you're a math major or a music major, consist of 1 semester of chemistry, 1 semseter of bio, 2 semesters of physics, and 2 semesters of calculus. they technically also include other requirements, but colloquially, people say "GIR" to refer to these 6 classes.
[^8]: some useful context about mit's reopening plan: seniors can come back in the fall and freshman + sophomores + juniors can come back in the spring. all classes that can be online will be online. you cannot take in-person classes unless you are on-campus and abide by mit's guidelines of social distancing, twice-a-week testing, etc. it's definitely one of the most conservative plans for bringing students back to campus (i think only paralelled by harvard's "only freshman, no in-person classes at all"). and it means that i will not be taking a class inside of mit again :(
[^9]: i also was taking this in part to fulfill a requirement for a Course 6 (cs) minor. I'm a firm believer in taking classes and just letting the minors pop out so whoops. looks like no course 6 minor for me.
[^10]: the ONLY dorm at mit that serves lunch. conveniently is close to campus. not-so-conveniently has much worse food than next house, my dorm! or at least, until this year… 
[^11]: [firehose.guide](), a tool developed by a student in their spare time to help people plan out their schedules
[^12]: https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/denied-by-mit-5-years-later/
[^13]: note that this does not stay more times than i can count. this is because i can only count to 3. i am aware of the existence of numbers beyond 3 but their ordering is a mystery that i will never know. (there are many phrases that i repeatedly tell other people; this is one of them. i have joked that you could replace me with a soundboard and it would take a very long time before people notice.)
