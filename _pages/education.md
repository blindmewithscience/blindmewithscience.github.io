Over the past 5 years, I've found a love of education I didn't know was possible. I started off by teaching competition math to elementary and middle school students, and I keepteaching in various ways to this day. Since then, I've become much more interested in expanding educational opportunities and educational policy.

## teaching

MIT Department of Economics
: *TA for 14.27 (Economics and E-Commerce), Fall 2019*
: This was my first chance to teach economics in a meaningful capacity. MIT Economics TAs are typically graduate students, and to my knowledge I'm one of only two undergraduate TAs for the department in recent memory. While my TAing wasn't perfect (making mistakes in office hours, imperfect recitation timing), I'd like to think I did a fairly good job in terms of helping students. The most fun I had here was getting to design recitations to introduce students to game theory, and creating problems that relate to some of the economics research that I do about comptition.
