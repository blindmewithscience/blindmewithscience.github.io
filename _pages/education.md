My work in economics has spanned from anti-trust to finance to policy to development to industrial organization. I'm also interested in education, market design, and game theory. Basically, I enjoy so many of the different things that economics does that I have no idea how I'll narrow it down.

## teaching

MIT Department of Economics
: *TA for 14.27 (Economics and E-Commerce), Fall 2019*
: This was my first chance to really teach economics. MIT Economics TAs are typically graduate students, and to my knowledge I'm one of only two undergraduate TAs for the department in recent memory. While my TAing wasn't perfect (making mistakes in office hours, imperfect recitation timing), I'd like to think I did a fairly good job in terms of helping students  â€” my final evaluation rating was a 5.8/7.
