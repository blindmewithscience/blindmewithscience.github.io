Here's a lot more random things that I participate in and enjoy, ranging from the semi-serious to the definitely-not-serious.

interests
---------

Memory
: For a class I taught at Splash, I learned how to memorize a deck of cards in a month. Current record is \~8 minutes. I also try to remember all the random facts that people tell me, from birthdays to class schedules to more.

Musicals
: I love musicals! Favorite ones I’ve seen in person are Hadestown, Waitress, and Les Mis. I’ve seen 16 musicals in-person and know the soundtracks to dozens more.

Scrabble
: Word games are fun, and Scrabble is my favorite. I’ve taught Splash classes about strategy and two-letter words. One long-term goal of mine is to join competitive Scrabble tournaments.

Jeopardy
: I’ve always wanted to make it onto Jeopardy. My main weaknesses right now are in literature and pop culture, so I’m trying to slowly build up that knowledge to have a shot at qualifying. Fingers crossed.

Deep Discussions
: I love talking to people to learn more about who they are and how they see the world. One semester, I ran a small discussion series to bring strangers together to talk about big questions like “How do you define yourself?” and “What brings meaning to your life?”

Rubik’s Cube Solving
: Fastest 3×3 solve is 11.08s. I also like trying to solve blindfolded, and my fastest is in 3:31 (though I average much closer to 7 minutes).

other activities
----------------

MIT Consulting Group
: I did DECA in high school, so I thought that consulting was an interesting enough thing that I could potentially do with my life. In joining MCG I feel like I've had the chance to actually impact real-life companies, including a handful related to education, helping transition an African entrepreneurship course to a mobile format and designing courses to help teachers in Brazil use one of the world's largest online educational platforms in their classrooms. I've learned a lot in MCG about effective presentation and slide design, but after a few years in MCG, I think I've decided that consulting isn't for me. While consulting can have large direct impacts on the world, I think that I appreciate the rigor that economics research has more.

Incube
: As part of a competition run by the ETH Entrepreneurship Club, I lived in a 270-square-foot glass box for 5 straight days with 4 other people as part of an entrepreneurship hackathon to "reimagine the future of ambulances." (Yeah, it's as wild as it sounds. To get a sense of what *real* people thought about it, check out some press coverage from [MIT News](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-student-entrepreneurs-think-inside-box-incube-1005), [Boston Globe](http://epaper.bostonglobe.com/infinity/article_popover_share.aspx?guid=b0189b60-e457-4a2f-8f1c-a223b14b1832), [BostInno](https://www.americaninno.com/boston/think-inside-a-box-mit-students-reimagine-the-ambulance-of-the-future/), [NBC Boston](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/why-mit-students-are-living-in-a-box-this-weekend/116370/), and [The Tech](https://thetech.com/2018/09/27/incube-competition-photos)). Working with Stryker, my team proposed Augmedic, an integrated vital sign monitoring system, winning second place in an international competition against 4 other "cubes." I joined Incube to push me *way* out of my comfort zone, never having done a hackathon or anything related to entrepreneurship before (not to mention living in a box). Incube was an incredibly interesting life experience, and one that has become by default "fun fact" to share during icebreakers.
