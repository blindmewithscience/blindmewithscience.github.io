Here's a lot more random things that I participate in and enjoy, ranging from
the semi-serious to the definitely-not-serious.

MIT Consulting Group

~   I did DECA in high school, so I thought that consulting was an interesting
    enough thing that I could potentially do with my life. In joining MCG I feel
    like I've had the chance to actually impact real-life companies, including a
    handful related to education, helping transition an African entrepreneurship
    course to a mobile format and designing courses to help teachers in Brazil
    use one of the world's largest online educational platforms in their
    classrooms. I've learned a lot in MCG about effective presentation and slide
    design, but after a few years in MCG, I think I've decided that consulting
    isn't for me. While consulting can have large direct impacts on the world, I
    think that I appreciate the rigor that economics research has more.

Incube

~   As part of a competition run by the ETH Entrepreneurship Club, I lived in a
    270-square-foot glass box for 5 straight days with 4 other people as part of
    an entrepreneurship hackathon to "reimagine the future of ambulances."
    (Yeah, it's as wild as it sounds. To get a sense of what *real* people
    thought about it, check out some press coverage from [MIT
    News](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-student-entrepreneurs-think-inside-box-incube-1005),
    [Boston

    [NBC
    Boston](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/why-mit-students-are-living-in-a-box-this-weekend/116370/),
    and [The Tech](https://thetech.com/2018/09/27/incube-competition-photos).
    Working with Stryker, my team proposed Augmedic, an integrated vital sign
    monitoring system, winning second place in an international competition
    against 4 other "cubes." I joined Incube to push me *way* out of my comfort
    zone, never having done a hackathon or anything related to entrepreneurship
    before (not to mention living in a box). Incube was an incredibly
    interesting life experience, and one that has become by default "fun fact"
    to share during icebreakers.

Memory

~   For a class I taught at Splash, I learned how to memorize a deck of cards in
    a month. Current record is \~8 minutes. I also try to remember all the
    random facts that people tell me, from birthdays to class schedules to more.

Musicals

~   I love musicals! Favorite ones I’ve seen in person are Hadestown, Waitress,
    and Les Mis. I’ve seen 16 musicals in-person and know the soundtracks to
    dozens more.

Rubik’s Cube Solving

~   Fastest 3×3 solve is 11.08s. I also like trying to solve blindfolded, and my
    fastest is in 3:31 (though I average much closer to 7 minutes).

Scrabble

~   Word games are fun, and Scrabble is my favorite. I’ve taught Splash classes
    about strategy and two-letter words. One long-term goal of mine is to join
    competitive Scrabble tournaments.

Jeopardy

~   I’ve always wanted to make it onto Jeopardy. My main weaknesses right now
    are in literature and pop culture, so I’m trying to slowly build up that
    knowledge to have a shot at qualifying. Fingers crossed.

Deep Discussions

~   I love talking to people to learn more about who they are and how they see
    the world. One semester, I ran a small discussion series to bring strangers
    together to talk about big questions like “How do you define yourself?” and
    “What brings meaning to your life?”
