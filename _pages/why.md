You just clicked a link to my website while ***on*** my website. Nice.

But ... why? I guess it doesn't matter now.

Don't want to take up too much of your time. Sending you back to the homepage in <span id="countdowntimer">10 </span> seconds.

<script type="text/javascript">
    var timeleft = 10;
    var downloadTimer = setInterval(function(){
    timeleft--;
    document.getElementById("countdowntimer").textContent = timeleft;
    if(timeleft <= 0)
        clearInterval(downloadTimer);
    },1000);
</script>
