My work in economics has spanned from anti-trust to finance to policy to development to industrial organization. I'm also interested in education, market design, and game theory. Basically, I enjoy so many of the different things that economics does that I have no idea how I'll narrow it down.

## research

J-PAL Southeast Asia: Transjakarta Bus Optimization
: *Work in progress with Dr. Ben Olken, Dr. Gabriel Kreindler, Dr. Rema Hanna, and Dr. Arya Gaduh.*
: This research experience exposed me to a side of economic research that I hadn’t been exposed to before. It largely focused on analyzing data from TransJakarta’s public bus system, using it to look at the impact of coronavirus lockdown measures, and also helping the system optimize the allocation of buses to routes. This project gave me a chance to hone my data skills and work in Python and Stata and work with large datasets in a way that I haven't done before. Overall, this experience helped me solidify some of my thoughts about graduate school in economics and what I’d like to study.

"[The Surprising Hybrid Pedigree of Measures of Diversity and Economic Concentration](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26512.pdf)"
: *Adajar, P., Berndt, E., and Conti, R. NBER Working Paper Series 26512. November 2019.*
: I've worked with Dr. Berndt and Dr. Conti for two years to write this paper about measuring concentration in markets and applying these measures to the pharmaceutical industry. I conducted an extensive literature review and used Stata and Python to calculate HHI (and other concentration indices) for the atorvastatin market. I've learned a lot from this project about research and understanding if I'd want to pursue a PhD in the future (probably).

"[Values: How do they Contribute to Economic Success?](http://www.na-businesspress.com/JOP/JOP18-1/PingleM_18_1.pdf)"
: *Pingle, M. and Adajar, P. Journal of Organizational Psychology, Vol. 18(1). 2018.*
: While in high school, I worked with Dr. Pingle on a variety of research projects. With this paper, I reviewed literature from economics, anthropology, and sociology to write sections discussing values, culture, and family operations. This was my first experience doing "real" economics, and it played a large factor in choosing to pursue it in college.

## work
Bridgewater Associates
: *Investment Engineer Intern, Summer 2020*
: Bridgewater is a company known for its [culture of "radical transparency."](https://www.bridgewater.com/media-archive/culture/) Interning at Bridgewater gave me a chance to grow a lot as a person as I learn how to better respond to feedback. Regarding the work itself, I think I learned a lot from my first experiences in the financial world and with being in industry and building systems for understanding the economy; you can read more of my thoughts on [this blog post]({% post_url 2020-08-22-bridgewater %}).

NERA
: *Anti-trust Intern, Winter 2020*
: I'd worked a lot in anti-trust because of my research about concentration measures, but NERA was a chance for me to do anti-trust in a much more applied manner with more focus on quantitative methods. NERA showed me what economics "industry" feels like: faster-paced, more emphasis on office communication, and the impetus to have deliverables.
: Perhaps the most interesting thing I figured out at NERA was how some associates (employees coming directly from undergrad) who initially planned to return to graduate school were slowly being convinced otherwise. Talking to these people helped me realize that I wanted the opposite — to return to graduate school, perhaps sooner rather than later.

Government Accountability Office
: *Student Intern --- Applied Research and Methods, Summer 2019*
: I worked at GAO as part of the [MIT-DC Internship Program](http://web.mit.edu/summerwash/). This internship and program helped expose me to the world of policy, and helped me decide to get a minor in the field. During the internship, I got to talk with many PhDs working in public policy about their experiences and why they (mostly) ended up leaving academia, which has helped me in understanding my own career goals.
