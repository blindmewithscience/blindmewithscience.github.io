<p><span style="font-size:xxx-large;"><strong>hi! i'm <span style="color:#ff6000;">paolo adajar</span></strong>.</span></p>

<p>Welcome to my website! This is still a work in progress. Hopefully it'll be more updated soon!</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm a junior at MIT studying mathematical economics. Outside of that, I spend a lot of time in the field of education and doing other random things across campus.

If you want the "here's what I did and things that make me somewhat competent," you should check out my resume. The content that I have on this site is an attempt to add more thoughts and context behind what I do, because I hope that people can know more about me than just "stuff I did."

I think a lot about understanding the world and how to go about life. You can find some of these reflections and general life updates on my blog</p>

<p>I'm hoping that this website serves as a way of understanding who I am, even if we've never met. And for those who do know me, it can serve as a way of seeing what I'm up to and thinking about. My first blog post elaborates a bit about what I want this website to be.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, comments, or thoughts, I'm a fairly easy-to-reach person â€” please say hi!</p>
