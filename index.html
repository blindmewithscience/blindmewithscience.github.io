<div class="notice--warning">Welcome! This website is still a <strong>work in progress</strong>. Hopefully it'll be more updated soon over the next few weeks!</div> 

<hr>

<p><span style="font-size:xxx-large;"><strong>hi! i'm <span style="color:#ff6000;">paolo adajar</span></strong>.</span></p>

<p>I'm a rising senior at MIT studying <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/economics>mathematical economics</a>. Outside of that, I spend a lot of time in the field of <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/education>education</a> and doing <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/more>other random things</a> with my life. You can check out my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog>blog</a> for my thoughts and reflections about going through life, as well as occasional updates about what I'm doing. </p> 

<p>The content that I have on this site is an attempt to add more thoughts and context behind what I do, because I hope that people can know more about me than just "stuff I did." But if you do just want that, you can check out my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/resume>resume</a>.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that this website serves as a way of understanding who I am, even if we've never met. And for those who do know me, it can serve as a way of seeing what I'm up to and thinking about. My <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/2020/05/18/beginnings/>first blog post</a> elaborates a bit about what I want this website to be.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, comments, or thoughts, I'm a fairly easy-to-reach person â€” please <a href="mailto:paoloadajar@mit.edu">say hi</a>!</p>
